# Intro to Webscraping Workshop

This code will get you started with learning the basics of using Python to get information from a website!

## Description
In this workshop, we will be scraping information from a static website, http://books.toscrape.com/

This website is designed as a sandbox for webscraping, which basically means we can try a lot of stuff out without worrying about overwhelming the site. 

By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to: 
1. describe what web scraping is at a high level, and list some of the basic tools used to work with data from the web
2. manipulate Python code to get information from a website
3. access information on a website using code
4. identify basic elements of a webpage

## To start:

1. Click on the "launch binder" button at the top of this page
2. Wait for the jupyter notebook to appear
3. In the window to the left, click on the file titled "webscraping-workshop"
4. Then, you will be able to run the code cell by cell! 


This workshop was designed for the University of Michigan Library Data Visualization Fellowship.
